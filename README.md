# Coursera Machine Learning Course Summary
This is a repository of my Machine Learning Assignments submitted for Andrew Ng's ML Coursera Course. I highly recommend this course to all individuals interested in kick-starting their understanding of Machine Learning programming! 

EX1 - Linear Regression  
In this exercise, I implemented linear regression on a dataset. 

EX2 - Logistic Regression  
In this exercise, I implement logistic regression onto two different datasets.

EX3 - Multi-class Classification and Neural Networks  
In this exercise, I implemented one-vs-all logistic regression and neural networks to recognize hand-written digits.

EX4 - Neural Network Learning  
In this exercise, I implemented the backpropagation algorithm for neural networks and applied it to the task of hand-written digit recognition.

EX5 - Regularized Linear Regression and Bias v.s. Variance  
In this exercise, I implemented regularized linear regression and used it to study models with different bias-variance properties.

EX6 - Support Vector Machines  
In this exercise, I used support vector machines (SVMs) to build a spam classifier.

EX7 - K-means Clustering and Principal Component Analysis  
In this exercise, I implemented the K-means clustering algorithm and applied it to compress an image. In the second part, I used principal component analysis to find a low-dimensional representation of face images.

EX8 - Anomaly Detection and Recommender Systems  
In this exercise, I implemented the anomaly detection algorithm and applied it to detect failing servers on a network. In the second part, I used collaborative filtering to build a recommender system for movies.
